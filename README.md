# MPP

This repository contains my work on the `MPP` course.

An application which manages `a motorcycling contest`, written in both `Java` and `.NET`.
Both applications are `Client-Server, using the Proxy design pattern`, with `JavaFX` and `Avalonia` as `UI Frameworks`.

It also contains some exercise projects for the practical exam and a template to use.
